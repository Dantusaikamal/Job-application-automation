# EDUCATION

Bharat Institute of Engineering and Technology
B.Tech. in Computer Science , GPA 8.0/10 , Hyderabad, 2019-2023

# Projects: 

• Leaf Disease Identification:
Built a cross platform mobile application using Flutter and TensorFlow that uses Machine Learning to detect 30+
diseases with an accuracy of 97.53%. The ML model is trained with a dataset of over 6.5 Lakh images and is integrated 
with an IBM Watson chatbot that can answer over 60 common questions on agriculture. There is also a language 
translation module that let’s a farmer use the application in their native language. 

• Telecom Churn Analysis using IBM AutoAI and Watson ML:
Developed a Machine Learning Model to predict customer churn in Telecommunication industry using Regression
techniques, XGBClassifier. By changing Regularization Parameter to 0.6, ended up obtaining an accuracy of 82%. 
Written a Research Paper for the same.

• Object Detection using Tensorflow.js:
Developed an object detection model using Tensorflow.js. I integrated the model into a web application developed 
using JavaScript to detect the object in real-time, using the live camera feed. The model can detect over 80 real
objects.

• Movie recommendation system:
Developed a Machine Learning Model using Pandas, Scikit learn, TfidfVectorizer that recommends movies to the users 
based on their past history. The content-based recommendation system has been trained with 50,000 rows of data. 
Similar models are being used in Amazon, Netflix, LinkedIn, Spotify and many more applications.

• Semantic Editing using StyleGAN :
A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks for editing hair attributes on real faces built 
using TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib, StyleGAN, Keras, and eval_js. Also optimized the GPU usage for training and 
testing the model by using different encoding optimizer functions.

• Pizza delivery Website :
Developed a responsive website using PHP and Laravel for a client in United Kingdom and deployed the web application 
in Heroku. Secured the authentication system and API end points for better security. Also integrated Razorpay payment 
gateway for making payments through the application. Used caching for fast performance of Website and for performing 
heavy tasks asynchronously. Integrated Third Party APIs for various tasks. 

# ACHIEVEMENTS
